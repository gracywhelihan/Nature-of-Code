# Assignment 4 - ocsillation

[Sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/gracywhelihan/sketches/A75y-ZRUd)

There was so much I wanted to do and I did not quite get there ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 
But that is ok! All of the material for this week kind of reminded me of a marble obsticle course:

Also there are those people on the internet who make these insane obstice courses that use strings and pans to get a ball from once place to another (I know there is another name for them but I can't remeber). Which actually go me thinking that this could something that I could create to help visualize my thesis....

Anyways, I started off creating a swirl class and it took me way too long to figure out how to get the swirl to turn around when it reaches the center and the starting point. I also want to rewrite the swirl code with vectors so that I can use accleration to make the swirls look more dynamic. I added in a sine wave to the sketch where the period is controlled by the y position of the mouse and the amplitude is controlled by the x position of the mouse. 
There is so much more I wanted to do, but time kind of got awayfom me this week so I didn't get much done :( I really wanted to play around with spring forces, but at the time that I am writing this I don't think I will have time.
