# Forces
I think [this](https://oimo.io/works) portfolio is super cool and seems to be using forces!

For my ICM final project I created a side scroll game. It turned out pretty well, but there was a lot more I wanted to do with it and make it seem more real. I feel using forces will add a lot to it, so I decided to recode my sidescoll game - well at least a simple version of it.

I used the same smiley class that I created last week and updated it to have an apply force function. Then I created a Pole class for the poles. I started off adding a gravity for on the smiley and a wind force on the poles.
