# Forces
I think [this](https://oimo.io/works) portfolio is super cool and seems to be using forces!
<br></br>
For my ICM final project I created a [side scroll game](https://editor.p5js.org/gracywhelihan/full/RYqma2zuF). It turned out pretty well, but there was a lot more I wanted to do with it but I felt a little limited and was kind of stuck. I think using forces will add a lot to it, so I decided to recode my sidescoll game - well at least a simple version of it.

I used the same smiley class that I created last week and updated it to have an apply force function. Then I created a Pole class for the poles. I started off adding a gravity for on the smiley and a wind force on the poles. They I added in a "run" force to move the smiley to the right when he jumps and a friction force to keep him stationary when he is on the ground. I then thought it would be fun to add a gust force that gets applied to the smiley if you jump too high. Right now I have edges for the smiley, but I think it would be more interesting if there were forces that kept it away from the edges. So, if I have time I will add those in. I also would like to add in some sort of button press count so that you can't jump forever. I think the biggest challenge with this will be getting all the forces to work the way I want them to. We talked about that in class - and it makes sense because there are so many forces acting on the smiley object that it will take a lot of finessing. 
Oh also, I hope to add some collision detection between the smiley and the poles.

Ah! The more I think about it and mess around with the forces the more I want to add!!
