# Final Proposal


As of right now I am unsure of what I want to make for my final at this exact moment, but I have a few ideas.

1. Combine this with something that we have learned in quantum technologies --> like using the magnitude and direction of a qubit as inputs for the magnitude and direction of a vector in p5. Or maybe have a bunch of "polarized sheets" that spin around and reveal something based on the angles their angles.
2. Make a plinko board with a soft bodies and the sensors in my phone to control the gravity. 
3. Create a genetic algorithm because I haven't really gotten to explore that and it would be really fun. But I dont have an exact direction yet.
4. Kind of continue with my midterm by adding more obsticles and make it more like a rube goldberg machine.
