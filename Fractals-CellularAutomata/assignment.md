## Past Cellular Automata

This week I have really had pasta on the brain, so I decided to make a CA with pasta shapes:

[pasta CA mouse](https://editor.p5js.org/gracywhelihan/sketches/4p4LsGnrs)
[pasta CA noise](https://editor.p5js.org/gracywhelihan/sketches/WGvEkuUhe)

I started out by making pngs of 4 different pasta shapes. As I was making the pngs I thought to myself that the pasta shapes kind of looked like vectors. So I thought it might be kind of cool to make a CA pasta vector field. I made each image into an object and started playing around with the angles.

I think CA and fractals are super cool. The idea of recursion is really interesting and really brings me back to calc 2 and working with sequences and series. If I had more time I would probably see if I could turn the pasta into the game of life, that could be fun. It also might hurt your eyes.
