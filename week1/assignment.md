# assingment 1 - random walk

The random walk assignment reminded me a lot of maze generation algorithms. Last year I read [Vizualizing Algorithms](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/) by Mike Bostock and in this paper he visualized multiple different maze generation algorithms, which I thought were super interesting. There is a "random walk" visualization which uses Wilsonâ€™s algorithm and loop-erased random walks to generate a uniform spanning tree. It can take a really long time the the maze to be fully generated with this algorithm, but it's pretty coool to watch.

When I was thinking about what kind of random walk I wanted to create for this weeks assingment I orignally thought I would like to create a random walk like the one vizualized by Wilson's Algorithm or the [Coding Train Self Avoidng Walk](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/162-self-avoiding-walk). But after watching the video and looking at the code, I figured I should maybe start with a more simple version of a random walk and work my way up.
