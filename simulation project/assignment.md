After learning about [Craig Renolds' Steering behaviors](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/) I thought the path following behavior was super interesting and I have kind of had this marble maze idea stuck in my head. I think I mentioned it in another weeks post.

I started off by trying to create different paths and connect them so that the vehicle (marble) could follow them. This actually took a lot of time, like way more time than I wanted it. But that is fine. There is a lot more I wanted to do, and I think would be cool to do with this marble maze. My code got pretty messy and sometimes the paths don't quite line up with the path drawings

Things to do in the future:
