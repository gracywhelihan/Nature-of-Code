[lil marble maze](https://editor.p5js.org/gracywhelihan/sketches/iBkQctRY_)

After learning about [Craig Renolds' Steering behaviors](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/) I thought the path following behavior was super interesting and I have kind of had this marble maze idea stuck in my head. I think I mentioned it in another weeks post.

I started off by trying to create different paths and connect them so that the vehicle (marble) could follow them. This actually took a lot of time, like way more time than I wanted it. But that is fine. There is a lot more I wanted to do, and I think would be cool to do with this marble maze. My code got pretty messy and sometimes the lil guy gets confused and falls off the path and starts back at the top of the section of that path. I think that I could put in some conditions to stop this from happening and potentially I could have just made one giant path instead of sections of paths. 

Things to do in the future:
- add some more forces like gravity
- I wanted to add arms to the lil guy with spring forces
- add some different types of obsticles like a trampoline or swings or something - like a [Rube Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) machine (thank you Dan for saying this in class I couldn't remember what it was called. 
- put in conditions to make the particle start over if it is too far from the path or "falls" off the path.
